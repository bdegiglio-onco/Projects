	If you are just installing the theme you do not need these plugins, as they are bundled in the theme folder
	and the theme will prompt you to install them as soon as you activate it. 
	
	These plugins are for people who are updating an older version of the theme and the theme needs updated plugins
	as well. You can updated the older plugin versions by overwriting them through ftp with the newer ones.

	Please look up the change log in the documentation folder, it tells you if need to update plugins when updating 
	to a newer version.
