	Diamond - Responsive Business WordPress Theme
	
	
===========================================================================================================

	Theme version: 1.0.1 (see changelog.txt for details)
	
	WordPress version supported: 4.0, 3.9
	
	Visual Composer support: 4.2.3 ( do not update visual composer to 4.3.x as it is not supported yet!)
	
===========================================================================================================
	
	Please be aware of these things:
	
	#1. The theme is in the /Theme folder.


	#2. Please read the theme's documentation first (found in /Documentation/Theme WP Documentation)
	    as it goes through everything needed for you to install, work and update the theme and the
	    plugins it uses.
	
	
	#3. When you buy the theme you get a license with it. Many people confuse this license, which is for the
		theme, with a license for the included Visual Composer plugin (that has the ability to autoupdate if
		you insert a license code for it). So the bottom line is that:
		
		- we have a developer license for the visual composer so you do not need to register it
		- you do not need the latest version of the plugin as it doesn't bring any new functionality to the theme. Even worse there 
		  is a chance that newer versions might break some of the extensions and customizations we made to visual composer! 
		- we are testing newer versions and when we decide that the theme is 100% compatible with them we update the theme, so you are not
		  missing out on anything 
	
	
	#4. If you need assistance with a problem and you don't find the solution in the documentation, 
	    just let me know and I'd be happy to help!
